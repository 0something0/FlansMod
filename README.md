# FLANS MOD for MC 1.3.2 #

This is the official port of Flan's Mod to 1.3.2

# INFORMATION TO HELPERS #

Forge is being used, so it should be easy.

Half script is done w00t ;).

If possible, we would need to adjust some of the vehicle / plane controls to make sure everything works properly with them.

HexAPI is PlayerAPI. just ours works with Forge :) [Re-name is temporary !]

'flan.server' is 'flan.common' it was a rename becuase LAN is a server [lol ...]

We are using a fixed NitroModelThingy. it is complied to work with Flan very well. [our fix.]

We still need to add Vehicle, Gun Station and Planes handler. that will make the spawn and work properly.
