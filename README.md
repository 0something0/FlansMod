# FLANS MOD for MC 1.3.2 #

Official port of FlansMod to 1.3.2.

# INFORMATION TO HELPERS #

Forge is being used, so it should be easy.

*Guns and boxes are being worked on by Daniel.
*Planes are being worked on by Aidan.
*Vehicles are being worked on by Abrar.
*Flan himself is working on special spawners for planes, guns, and vehicles. This should fix the bugs we have run
into when placing the entities.

We are in need of a coder who can help out with packets -- wherever we need them.  Because FlansMod for 1.2.5 was strictly
client-only, it's going to take some work to get planes, vehicles, guns, and boxes working on both client and server.

If possible, we would need to adjust some of the vehicle / plane controls to make sure everything works properly with them.

We are using a fixed NitroModelThingy. it is complied to work with Flan very well. [our fix.]

# CURRENT GOALS #
*Set up a packet system for server and client.

*Set up a special plane/gun/vehicle spawning system.

*Remove PlayerAPI dependencies by using the hooks Forge v4.0.0 adds.

# INSTALLATION #

Drop new source code into fresh MCP, everything is included.
